                    <p><strong>About</strong></p>

                    <p>Michign EcoData is a project based student organization at the University of Michigan that fosters a space for creative, impact driven, and student led projects that address environmental and sustainability issues through data science and technological solutions. A large motivational factor for EcoData members is publishing their finalized projects on the [<a href="michiganecodata.org">organization's website</a>]. The website is regularly viewed by prospective members, university faculty, and community members and has been the source of new projects, funding, and external relationships.The website deveopment team also offers Michigan EcoData members an opportunity to work hands-on with a public access website.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

                    <div class="two-col">
                        <div> 
                            <p>Although Michigan EcoData was only in its 3rd year, the club website had seen over 10 different developers and was severely outdated. As acting website director, I decided to completely overhaul the website. Our team identified 3 major issues we wanted to address in the site redesign:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Remove the landing page to improve website accessibility</li>
                                <li>Modernize the design to better reflect the direction of the organization</li>
                                <li>Thoroughly document the file structure and code, so the website could easily scale up as new members and projects were added</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>

                    <p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Figma Redesign (3 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Simultaneous code editing platform research and selection (3 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Content curation (10 weeks)</li>
                        <li>File structure set up and documentation (2 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Website coding (4 months)</li>

                <div>
                    <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Time - Every member of the website development team was also working on projects within the club, so finding time to work on the website was always challenging.</li>
                        <li>Sumultaneous code editing - Working on code simultaneously with team members who had never used Git took some patience and research. We ultimately edited our code on Replit, which allowed members to see real-time edits and push to GitHub in a user friendly interface.</li>
                        <li>Content curation - The team had to dig deep into the Michigan EcoData archives to find project descriptions and outcomes that had been poorly documented.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div>

                            <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>

                            <p>After many lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website development team completed the new site in August 2023, roughly one year after the start of the redesign process. The new site is publically accessible at <a href="https://www.michiganecodata.org">www.michiganecodata.org</a> and has received much praise from the internal members, Michigan faculty, and the Michigan Institute for Data Science (Michigan EcoData's sponsoring organization). As I move into the Executive Director role, the new website development team has found ease in adding projects and members to the website.</p>
