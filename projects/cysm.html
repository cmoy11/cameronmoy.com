                    <p><strong>About</strong></p>
    
                    <p>Every summer, Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute) hosts a 48 hour intern Hackathon. Interns were divided into 23 teams and tasked to build an app that utilized the company's GIS technologies in some capacity. Our team developed a facial recognition, photo-sharing app. Cleverly name Can You See Me, our app not only provided interns (and future users) a space to share photos and reminisce on memories, filterable by person, location, or date, but also offered the University Relations team (and future event hosts) the opportunity to gain insights on popular photo-taking locations and activities through Esri's geospatial analytics tools.</p>

                    <p>As the product manager, I hosted brainstorming sessions and helped to scope and realize our app. Once our team started developing the app, we naturally ran into barriers, and I worked to mitigate issues and forge a path forward, drawing on my technical background and communication skills. I was also able to support Sheryl, our team's UX Designer, with some supplementary front-end development. Upon the completion of Can You See Me, I worked with Amanda, our team's GIS Specialist and Solutions Engineer, to craft a presentation that we would ultimately give to the entire company.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Time Constraints - Naturally, developing an app in 48 hours was no easy feat. Through open communication and strong time management, however, we were able to create a fully functional app.</li>
                        <li>Difference in Backgrounds - Like any team, we had differences in the skills and background knowledge we were bringing to the project. Although understanding the capabilities of unfamiliar technologies was challenging at times, we were all able to learn new skills from each other.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>

                    <p>Of the 23 intern Hackathon teams, ours was the only team that presented a live, working demo. During the preliminary round of judging, our team placed second and advanced to the final presentation. Our presentation was in-person and streamed live to the 5,000 person company where we were awarded the most creative app. Check out our final presentation below!</p>
