                    <p><strong>About</strong></p>

                    <p>The City of Detroit announced a public-private-community partnership, <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/departments/police-department/project-green-light-detroit">Project Green Light (PGL)</a>, in 2016 as a measure to reduce and prevent crime. Under this parnership, local businesses pay to install a Green Light camera at their establishment in exchange for the city's 24/7 surveillance. PGL employs facial recognition to "deter, identify, and solve crime," which has become contentious in the academic community. Despite known racial bias in facial recognition technologies and <a href = "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/04/13/detroit-police-wrongful-arrest-faulty-facial-recognition/7207135002/">incidents of misidentification</a>, the City of Detroit lauds the program's success.</p>

                    <div class ="two-col">
                        <p>In response to PGL, our team looked to understand Detroit residents' perception of neighborhood safety and surveillance through Community Based Participatory Research. I worked with Ph.D. Candidate, Alex Lu, to develop a photovoice research project with Detroit nonprofit partner, Eastside Community Network. We engaged with 11 Eastside Detroit residents over the course of the three month study. During this time, we hosted workshops about the history of photovoice and surveillance technologies, office hours to support the photo taking process, especially with our older participants, and community conversations around sentiments of neighborhood safety, crime, and surveillance. The study culminated in a public photo exhibition (pictured below), where our participants discussed their photos with the greater community and shared experiences with residents across generations. Findings from this work recently appeared at CHI 2023 (presentor) and DIS 2023 (best paper) and future work can be found [<a href="btn.html">Here</a>].</p>
